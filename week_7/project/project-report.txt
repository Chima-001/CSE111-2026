            Time Spent
   Date       (hours)   Description of Work
----------  ----------  -------------------------
2026-01-29      3       I made researches, installed cryptography module and initialized the Password and PasswordVault classes

2026-02-02      1       I wrote the add_password method and watched a video on how to use the cryptography module for encryption

2026-02-03      2       I wrote the save_to_file and load_from_file methods and wrote the gen_password method which calls the generate_password 
                        funtion from the passwords.py module to automatically generate passwords for the user

2026-02-05      4       I wrote the delete_password, get_password, list_services and edit_password methods (functions). I also wrote the test_fuctions
                        in the test_passwords_manager.py program to test the methods (functions) I have written already

2026-02-06      3       I wrote the _encrypt and _decrypt methods using the cryptography module, to encrypt the passwords before they are written/saved 
                        to the passwords.txt file and decrypt the passwords each time they are being loaded from the file, and the _setup_encryption method 
                        (setting this up took me a while to figure out). I wrote the test_fuctions for the methods I added today. I also added try and except
                        checks for the necessary methods.

2026-02-07      4       I wrote the main function and called every method to their respective uses. I spent most of the time cross-checking and fixing errors
                        in each method/function.
